I am an associate professor in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.skku.edu/) at College of Computing in [Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)](https://skku.edu/). Currently, I am leading [SecAI Lab](https://secai.skku.edu) at SKKU. I was a postdoctoral researcher at [SSLab](https://gts3.org/) in Georgia Tech, working with [Taesoo Kim](https://taesoo.kim/). I earned my Ph.D. in [Computer Science (CS) from Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/) (adviser: [Michalis Polychronakis](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/)). I received the M.Sc. degree in Information Security from [Korea University](http://www.korea.ac.kr/), working at the [Digital Forensics Lab (DFRC)](http://forensic.korea.ac.kr/) with Sangjin Lee. I studied computer science in the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) as an exchange student. I also had worked for [Samsung SDS](http://www.samsungsds.com/) and [Shinhan bank](http://www.shinhan.com) in a security team. I am fortunate to have a variety of interesting experiences from both industrial and academic sides in the security field, thanks to the great people who led me.

With the _Internet of Things_, security matters everywhere by getting more connected each other ever. So I wanted to make this space reserved for writing down stuff (security findings, knowledge I often forget, what I have done for fun and so on). I like dealing with practical security which impacts on human's life, based upon theory.
