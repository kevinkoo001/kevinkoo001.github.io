PGP is a software package that performs cryptographic tasks related with email systems, which stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It is created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991, and now regarded as de facto standard email security. PGP is currently acquired by Symantec Group since 2010, but still the source code is available for peer review. There are many PGP variants available such as OpenPGP, GPG, iPGMail, APG, and so forth.

PGP provides security services and privacy using a series of security techniques including:
(1) Hashing for integrity
(2) Data compression
(3) Symmetric cryptography for confidentiality
(4) Asymmetric cryptography for both authentication and non-repudiation
