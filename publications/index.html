Visual similarity-based detection systems have emerged as an effective countermeasure, but their effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios have been underexplored. In this paper, we comprehensively scrutinize and evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of popular visual similarity-based anti-phishing models using a large-scale dataset of 451k real-world phishing websites. Our analyses of the effectiveness reveal that while certain visual similarity-based models achieve high accuracy on curated datasets in the experimental settings, they exhibit notably low performance on real-world datasets, highlighting the importance of real-world evaluation. Furthermore, we find that the attackers evade the detectors mainly in three ways: (1) directly attacking the model pipelines, (2) mimicking benign logos, and (3) employing relatively simple strategies such as eliminating logos from screenshots. To statistically assess the resilience and robustness of existing models against adversarial attacks, we categorize the strategies attackers employ into visible and perturbation-based manipulations and apply them to website logos. We then evaluate the models’ robustness using these adversarial samples. Our findings reveal potential vulnerabilities in several models, emphasizing the need for more robust visual similarity techniques capable of withstanding sophisticated evasion attempts. We provide actionable insights for enhancing the security of phishing defense systems, encouraging proactive actions.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">phishing-models-usenix25</span><span class="p">,</span>

However, these pervasive utilities in the cloud environment unavoidably encounter security and privacy issues. In particular, a membership inference attack (MIA) poses a threat by recognizing the presence of a data sample in a training set for the target model. Although prior MIA approaches underline privacy risks repeatedly by demonstrating experimental results with standard benchmark datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR. However, the effectiveness of such techniques on a real-world dataset remains questionable. We are the first to perform an in-depth empirical study on black-box based MIAs that hold realistic assumptions, including six metric-based and three classifier-based MIAs with the high-dimensional image dataset that consists of identification (ID) cards and driving licenses. Additionally, we introduce the Siamese-based MIA that shows similar or better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches and suggest training a shadow model with autoencoder-based reconstructed images. Our major findings show that the performance of MIA techniques against too many features may be degraded; the MIA configuration or a sample’s properties can impact the accuracy of membership inference on members and non-members.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">blackbox-mia</span><span class="p">,</span>

It serves as a basis to aid reverse engineers in comprehending the contextual semantics of the code. In this respect, commercial decompilers like Hex-Rays have made significant strides in improving the readability of decompiled code over time. While previous work has proposed the metrics for assessing the readability of source code, including identifiers, variable names, function names, and comments, those metrics are unsuitable for measuring the readability of decompiled code primarily due to i) the lack of rich semantic information in the source and ii) the presence of erroneous syntax or inappropriate expressions. In response, to the best of our knowledge, this work first introduces R2I, the Relative Readability Index, a specialized metric tailored to evaluate decompiled code in a relative context quantitatively. In essence, R2I can be computed by i) taking code snippets across different decompilers as input and ii) extracting pre-defined features from an abstract syntax tree. For the robustness of R2I, we thoroughly investigate the enhancement efforts made by existing decompilers and academic research to promote code readability, identifying 31 features to yield a reliable index collectively. Besides, we conducted a user survey to capture subjective factors such as one’s coding styles and preferences. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that R2I is a versatile metric capable of representing the relative quality of decompiled code (e.g., obfuscation, decompiler updates) and being well aligned with human perception in our survey.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">r2i</span><span class="p">,</span>

Yet, it is challenging to read the original semantics from a binary code snippet because of the unavailability of high-level information in the source, such as function names, variable names, and types. Recent advancements in deep learning show the possibility of recovering such vanished information with a well-trained model from a pre-defined dataset. Albeit a static model’s notable performance, it can hardly cope with ever-increasing data stream (e.g., compiled binaries) by nature. The two viable approaches for ceaseless learning are retraining the whole dataset from scratch and fine-tuning a pre-trained model; however, retraining suffers from large computational overheads and fine-tuning from performance degradation (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). Lately, continual learning (CL) tackles the problem of handling incremental data in security domains (e.g., network intrusion detection, malware detection) using reasonable resources while maintaining performance in practice. In this paper, we focus on how CL assists the improvement of a generative model that predicts a function symbol name from a series of machine instructions. To this end, we introduce BinAdapter, a system that can infer function names from an incremental dataset without performance degradation from an original dataset by leveraging CL techniques. Our major finding shows that incremental tokens in the source (i.e., machine instructions) or the target (i.e., function names) largely affect the overall performance of a CL-enabled model. Accordingly, BinAdapter adopts three built-in approaches: i) inserting adapters in case of no incremental tokens in both the source and target, ii) harnessing multilingual neural machine translation (M-NMT) and fine-tuning the source embeddings with i) in case of incremental tokens in the source, and iii) fine-tuning target embeddings with ii) in case of incremental tokens in both. To demonstrate the effectiveness of BinAdapter, we evaluate the above three scenarios using incremental datasets with or without a set of new tokens (e.g., unseen machine instructions or function names), spanning across different architectures and optimization levels. Our empirical results show that BinAdapter outperforms the state-of-the-art CL techniques for an F1 of up to 24.3% or a Rouge-l of 21.5% in performance.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">binadapter</span><span class="p">,</span>

A wealth of prior studies mostly focuses on the inference of a popular compiler toolchain for C and C++ languages from stripped binaries that are built with GCC or clang. Lately, the popularity of an emerging compiler is on the rise such as Rust, Go, and Nim programming languages that complement the downsides of C and C++ (e.g., security), which little has been explored on them. The main challenge arises when applying previous inference techniques for toolchain provenance because some emerging compilation toolchains adopt the same backend of traditional compilers. In this paper, we propose ToolPhet, an effective end-to-end BERT-based system for deducing the provenance of both traditional and emerging compiler toolchains. To this end, we thoroughly study the characteristics of both an emerging toolchain and an executable binary that is generated by that toolchain. We introduce two separate downstream tasks for the compiler toolchain inference with a (BERT-based) fine-tuning process, which produces i) a toolchain classification model, and ii) a binary code similarity detection model. Our findings show that the classification model (i) may not suffice when producing a binary with the existing backend like Nim, which we adopt the detection model (ii) that can infer underlying code semantics. We evaluate ToolPhet with the previous work including one signature-based tool and four machine-learning-based approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness by achieving higher F1 scores with the binaries compiled with emerging compilation toolchains. </p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">toolphet</span><span class="p">,</span>

Despite the increasing popularity of fuzzing, automated root cause analysis (RCA) has drawn less attention. One of the recent advances in RCA is crash-based statistical debugging, which leverages the behavioral differences in program execution between crash-triggered and non-crashing inputs. Hence, obtaining non-crashing behaviors close to the original crash is crucial but challenging with previous approaches (e.g., fuzzing). In this paper, we present BENZENE, a practical end-to-end RCA system that facilitates an automated crash diagnosis. To this end, we introduce a novel technique, called under-constrained state mutation, that generates both crashing and non-crashing behaviors for effective and efficient RCA. We design and implement the BENZENE prototype, and evaluate it with 60 vulnerabilities in the wild. Our empirical results demonstrate that BENZENE not only surpasses in performance (i.e., root cause ranking), but also achieves superior results in both speed (4.6 times faster) and memory footprint (31.4 times less) on average than prior approaches.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">benzene</span><span class="p">,</span>

In response, the global anti-phishing entity (e.g., APWG) collectively maintains the up-to-date blacklist database (e.g., eCrimeX) against phishing campaigns, and so do modern browsers (e.g., Google Safe Browsing). However, our finding reveals that such a mutual assistance system has remained a blind spot when detecting geolocation-based phishing campaigns. In this paper, we focus on phishing campaigns against the web portal service with the largest number of users (42 million) in South Korea. We harvest 1,558 phishing URLs from varying resources in the span of a full year, of which only a small fraction (3.8%) have been detected by eCrimeX despite a wide spectrum of active fraudulence cases. We demystify three pervasive types of phishing campaigns in South Korea: i) sophisticated phishing campaigns with varying adversarial tactics such as a proxy configuration, ii) phishing campaigns against a second-hand online market, and iii) phishing campaigns against a non-specific target. Aligned with previous findings, a phishing kit that supports automating the whole phishing campaign is prevalent. Besides, we frequently observe a hit-andrun scam where a phishing campaign is immediately inaccessible right after victimization is complete, each of which is tailored to a single potential victim over a new channel like a messenger. As part of mitigation efforts, we promptly provide regional phishing information to APWG, and immediately lock down a victim’s account to prevent further damages. </p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">phishhunter</span><span class="p">,</span>

To accomplish this, advancements on binary code analysis borrow the techniques from natural language processing to automatically infer the underlying semantics of a binary, rather than replying on manual analysis. One of crucial pipelines in this process is instruction normalization, which helps to reduce the number of tokens and to avoid an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. However, existing approaches often substitutes the operand(s) of an instruction with a common token (e. g., callee target → FOO), inevitably resulting in the loss of important information. In this paper, we introduce well-balanced instruction normalization (WIN), a novel approach that retains rich code information while minimizing the downsides of code normalization. With large swaths of binary code, our finding shows that the instruction distribution follows Zipf’s Law like a natural language, a function conveys contextually meaningful information, and the same instruction at different positions may require diverse code representations. To show the effectiveness of WIN, we present DEEP SEMANTIC that harnesses the BERT architecture with two training phases: pre-training for generic assembly code representation, and fine-tuning for building a model tailored to a specialized task. We define a downstream task of binary code similarity detection, which requires underlying code semantics. Our experimental results show that our binary similarity model with WIN outperforms two state-of-the-art binary similarity tools, DeepBinDiff and SAFE, with an average improvement of 49.8% and 15.8%, respectively.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">win-normalization</span><span class="p">,</span>

Despite its growing popularity for many blockchain platforms like Ethereum, no technical means is available even when a smart contract requires to be protected from being copied. One promising direction to claim a software ownership is software watermarking. However, applying existing software watermarking techniques is challenging because of the unique properties of a smart contract, such as a code size constraint, non-free execution cost, and no support for dynamic allocation under a virtual machine environment. This paper introduces a novel software watermarking scheme, dubbed Smartmark, aiming to protect the ownership of a smart contract against a pirate activity. Smartmark builds the control flow graph of a target contract runtime bytecode, and locates a collection of bytes that are randomly elected for representing a watermark. We implement a full-fledged prototype for Ethereum, applying Smartmark to 27,824 unique smart contract bytecodes. Our empirical results demonstrate that Smartmark can effectively embed a watermark into a smart contract and verify its presence, meeting the requirements of credibility and imperceptibility while incurring an acceptable performance degradation. Besides, our security analysis shows that Smartmark is resilient against viable watermarking corruption attacks; e.g., a large number of dummy opcodes are needed to disable a watermark effectively, resulting in producing an illegitimate smart contract clone that is not economical.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">smartmark</span><span class="p">,</span>

Once debugging symbols (e.g., variable names, types, function names) are discarded, recovering such information is not technically viable with traditional approaches like static or dynamic binary analysis. We focus on a function symbol name recovery, which allows a reverse engineer to gain a quick overview of an unseen binary. The key insight is that a well-developed program labels a meaningful function name that describes its underlying semantics well. In this paper, we present AsmDepictor, the Transformer-based framework that generates a function symbol name from a set of assembly codes (i.e., machine instructions), which consists of three major components: binary code refinement, model training, and inference. To this end, we conduct systematic experiments on the effectiveness of code refinement that can enhance an overall performance. We introduce the per-layer positional embedding and Unique-softmax for AsmDepictor so that both can aid to capture a better relationship between tokens. Lastly, we devise a novel evaluation metric tailored for a short description length, the Jaccard* score. Our empirical evaluation shows that the performance of AsmDepictor by far surpasses that of the state-of-the-art models up to around 400%. The best AsmDepictor model achieves an F1 of 71.5 and Jaccard* of 75.4.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">asmdepictor</span><span class="p">,</span>

While flexible, such vast APIs inevitably bring a significant increase in an API attack surface, which commonly corresponds to a functionality that is neither needed nor wanted by the application. A promising approach to reduce the API attack surface is software debloating, a technique wherein an unused functionality is programmatically removed from an application. Unfortunately, debloating PWAs is challenging, given the monolithic design and non-deterministic execution of a modern web browser. In this paper, we present DeView, a practical approach that reduces the attack surface of a PWA by blocking unnecessary but accessible web APIs. DeView tackles the challenges of PWA debloating by i) record-and-replay web API profiling that identifies needed web APIs on an app-by-app basis by replaying (recorded) browser interactions and ii) compiler-assisted browser debloating that eliminates the entry functions of corresponding web APIs from the mapping between web API and its entry point in a binary. Our evaluation shows the effectiveness and practicality of DeView. DeView successfully eliminates 91.8% of accessible web APIs while i) maintaining original functionalities and ii) preventing 76.3% of known exploits on average.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">deview</span><span class="p">,</span>

However, the inference of contextual meanings of a binary is challenging due to the absence of semantic information available in source codes. Recent advances leverage the benefits of a deep learning architecture into a better understanding of underlying code semantics and the advantages of the Siamese architecture into better BCSD. In this paper, we propose BinShot, a BERT-based similarity learning architecture that is highly transferable for effective BCSD. We tackle the problem of detecting code similarity with one-shot learning (a special case of few-shot learning). To this end, we adopt a weighted distance vector with a binary cross entropy as a loss function on top of BERT. With the prototype of BinShot, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, and practicality of BinShot, which is robust to detecting the similarity of previously unseen functions. We show that BinShot outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches for BCSD.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">binshot</span><span class="p">,</span>

On the other hand, IoT device manufacturers tend to employ proprietary operating systems and network protocols, which may lead device interoperability issues. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) has established a standard protocol for seamless IoT communication. IoTivity is one of reference implementations that conforms to the OCF specification. IoTivity utilizes both Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to support a lightweight and secure communication. Although a packet analysis tool like Wireshark offers a feature to decrypt messages over TLS or DTLS by feeding a session key that a Web browser records, it cannot be directly applied to IoTivity because it lacks such a key-tracing functionality. In this paper, we present an IoTivity Packet Parser (IPP) for encrypted CoAP messages tailored to IoTivity. To this end, we modify IoTivity source code to extract required keys, and leverage them to parse each field automatically for further protocol analysis in a handy manner.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">iotivity</span><span class="p">,</span>

Software watermarking is one of the promising techniques to verify the owner of licensed software by embedding a digital fingerprint. Developing an ideal software watermark scheme is challenging because i) unlike digital media watermarking, software watermarking must preserve the original code semantics after inserting software watermark, and ii) it requires well-balanced properties of credibility, resiliency, capacity, imperceptibility, and efficiency. We present SoftMark, a software watermarking system that leverages a function relocation where the order of functions implicitly encodes a hidden identifier. By design, SoftMark does not introduce additional structures (i.e., codes, blocks, or subroutines), being robust in unauthorized detection, while maintaining a negligible performance overhead and reasonable capacity. With various strategies against viable attacks (i.e., static binary re-instrumentation), we tackle the limitations of previous reordering-based approaches. Our empirical results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness by successful embedding and extraction of various watermark values.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">softmark</span><span class="p">,</span>

In this paper, we aim to fill the void of what has been overlooked or misinterpreted by closely looking into the previous datasets, metrics, and evaluations with varying case studies. Our major findings are that i) a common corpus like GNU utilities is insufficient to represent the effectiveness of function identification, ii) it is difficult to claim, at least in the current form, that an ML-oriented approach is scientifically superior to deterministic ones like IDA or Ghidra, iii) the current metrics may not be reasonable enough to measure varying function detection cases, and iv) the capability of recognizing functions depends on each tool’s strategic or peculiar choice. We perform re-evaluation of existing approaches on our own dataset, demonstrating that not a single state-of-the-art tool dominates all the others. In conclusion, a function detection problem has not yet been fully addressed, and we need a better methodology and metric to make advances in the field of function identification.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">lookback</span><span class="p">,</span>

The most popular browser, Chromium, has become an extremely complex application to meet ever-increasing user demands, exposing unavoidably large attack vectors due to its large code base. Code debloating attracts attention as a means of reducing such a potential attack surface by eliminating unused code. However, it is very challenging to perform sophisticated code removal without breaking needed functionalities because Chromium operates on a large number of closely connected and complex components, such as a renderer and JavaScript engine. In this paper, we present Slimium, a debloating framework for a browser (i.e., Chromium) that harnesses a hybrid approach for a fast and reliable binary instrumentation. The main idea behind Slimium is to determine a set of features as a debloating unit on top of a hybrid (i.e., static, dynamic, heuristic) analysis, and then leverage feature subsetting to code debloating. It aids in i) focusing on security-oriented features, ii) discarding unneeded code simply without complications, and iii) reasonably addressing a non-deterministic path problem raised from code complexity. To this end, we generate a feature-code map with a relation vector technique and prompt webpage profiling results. Our experimental results demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of Slimium for 40 popular websites, as on average it removes 94 CVEs (61.4%) by cutting down 23.85 MB code (53.1%) from defined features (21.7% of the whole) in Chromium.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">slimium</span><span class="p">,</span>

Existing debloating approaches either statically remove code that is guaranteed to not run (e.g., non-imported functions from shared libraries), or rely on profiling with realistic workloads to pinpoint and keep only the subset of code that was executed. In this work, we explore an alternative configuration-driven software debloating approach that removes feature-specific code that is exclusively needed only when certain configuration directives are specified—which are often disabled by default. Using a semi-automated approach, our technique identifies libraries solely needed for the implementation of a particular functionality and maps them to certain configuration directives. Based on this mapping, feature-specific libraries are not loaded at all if their corresponding directives are disabled. The results of our experimental evaluation with Nginx, VSFTPD, and OpenSSH show that using the default configuration in each case, configuration-driven debloating can remove 77% of the code for Nginx, 53% for VSFTPD, and 20% for OpenSSH, which represent a significant attack surface reduction.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">conf-debloating</span><span class="p">,</span>

Code randomization, an effective defense against return-oriented programming exploits, has remained an academic exercise mainly due to i) the lack of a transparent and streamlined deployment model that does not disrupt existing software distribution norms, and ii) the inherent incompatibility of program variants with error reporting, whitelisting, patching, and other operations that rely on code uniformity. In this work, we present compiler-assisted code randomization (CCR), a hybrid approach that relies on compiler–rewriter cooperation to enable fast and robust fine-grained code randomization on end-user systems, while maintaining compatibility with existing software distribution models. The main concept behind CCR is to augment binaries with a minimal set of transformation-assisting metadata, which i) facilitate rapid fine-grained code transformation at installation or load time, and ii) form the basis for reversing any applied code transformation when needed, to maintain compatibility with existing mechanisms that rely on referencing the original code. We have implemented a prototype of this approach by extending the LLVM compiler toolchain, and developing a simple binary rewriter that leverages the embedded metadata to generate randomized variants using basic block reordering. The results of our experimental evaluation demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of CCR, as on average it incurs a modest file size increase of 11.46% and a negligible runtime overhead of 0.28%, while it is compatible with link-time optimization and control flow integrity.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">ccr</span><span class="p">,</span>

The full power and flexibility of ROP attacks was recently demonstrated using just-in-time ROP tactics (JIT-ROP), whereby an adversary repeatedly leverages a memory disclosure vulnerability to identify useful instruction sequences and compile them into a functional ROP payload at runtime. Since the advent of just-in-time code reuse attacks, numerous proposals have surfaced for mitigating them, the most practical of which involve the re-randomization of code at runtime or the destruction of gadgets upon their disclosure. Even so, several avenues exist for performing code inference, which allows JIT-ROP attacks to infer values at specific code locations without directly reading the memory contents of those bytes. This is done by reloading code of interest or implicitly determining the state of randomized code. These so-called “zombie gadgets” completely undermine defenses that rely on destroying code bytes once they are read. To mitigate these attacks, we present a low-overhead, binary-compatible defense which ensures an attacker is unable to execute gadgets that were identified through code reloading or code inference. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed defense for closed-source Windows binaries, and demonstrate that our approach effectively prevents zombie gadget attacks with negligible runtime overhead.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">rerand</span><span class="p">,</span>

The intuition is that by destroying code as it is read, an adversary is left with no usable gadgets to reuse in a control-flow hijacking attack. In this paper, we examine the security of this new mitigation. We show that while the concept initially appeared promising, there are several unforeseen attack tactics that render destructive code reads ineffective in practice. Specifically, we introduce techniques for leveraging constructive reloads, wherein multiple copies of native code are loaded into a process’ address space (either side-by-side or one-after-another). Constructive reloads allow the adversary to disclose one code copy, destroying it in the process, then use another code copy for their code reuse payload. For situations where constructive reloads are not viable, we show that an alternative, and equally powerful, strategy exists: leveraging code association via implicit reads, which allows an adversary to undo in-place code randomization by inferring the layout of code that follows already disclosed bytes. As a result, the implicitly learned code is not destroyed, and can be used in the adversary’s code reuse attack. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques with concrete instantiations of these attacks against popular applications. In light of our successes, we argue that the code inference strategies presented herein paint a cautionary tale for defensive approaches whose security blindly rests on the perceived inability to undo the application of in-place randomization.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">zombie-gadgets</span><span class="p">,</span>

Although a wide range of code diversification techniques of varying levels of granularity exist, most of them rely on the availability of source code, debug symbols, or the assumption of fully precise code disassembly, limiting their practical applicability for the protection of closed-source third-party applications. In-place code randomization has been proposed as an alternative binary-compatible diversification technique that is tolerant of partial disassembly coverage, in the expense though of leaving some gadgets intact, at the disposal of attackers. Consequently, the possibility of constructing robust ROP payloads using only the remaining non-randomized gadgets is still open. In this paper we present instruction displacement, a code diversification technique based on static binary instrumentation that does not rely on complete code disassembly coverage. Instruction displacement aims to improve the randomization coverage and entropy of existing binary-level code diversification techniques by displacing any remaining non-randomized gadgets to random locations. The results of our experimental evaluation demonstrate that instruction displacement reduces the number of non-randomized gadgets in the extracted code regions from 15.04% for standalone in-place code randomization, to 2.77% for the combination of both techniques. At the same time, the additional indirection introduced due to displacement incurs a negligible runtime overhead of 0.36% on average for the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">juggling</span><span class="p">,</span>

There is active discussion on whether and how ISPs should be allowed to differentiate Internet traffic, but little data about current practices to inform this discussion. Previous work attempted to address this problem for fixed line networks; however, there is currently no solution that works in the more challenging mobile environment.In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the first system and mobile app for identifying traffic differentiation for arbitrary applications in the mobile environment (i.e., wireless networks such as cellular and WiFi, used by smartphones and tablets). The key idea is to use a VPN proxy to record and replay the network traffic generated by arbitrary applications, and compare it with the network behavior when replaying this traffic outside of an encrypted tunnel. We perform the first known testbed experiments with actual commercial shaping devices to validate our system design and demonstrate how it outperforms previous work for detecting differentiation. We released our app and collected differentiation results from 12 ISPs in 5 countries. We find that differentiation tends to affect TCP traffic (reducing rates by up to 60%) and that interference from middleboxes (including video-transcoding devices) is pervasive. By exposing such behavior, we hope to improve transparency for users and help inform future policies.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">traffic-differentiation</span><span class="p">,</span>
